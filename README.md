# Ruby on Rails Associations Project
based on The Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/associations)

In this project I am asked to create an application in Ruby on Rails that allows users to create events and attend events. The event host manages the event details and user signups.

I will be utilizing the skills I have developed thus far in the curriculum.
